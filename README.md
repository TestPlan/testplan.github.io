# PIG GAME

## A coding challenge from a Udemy JavaScript course

### Rules:
 - This is a 2 player game.
 - In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result get added to their round score.
 - If the player rolls a 1, the round score is lose, and it's the next player's turn.
 - The player can choose to 'hold', which means that their round score gets added to their total score, and the turn ends.
 - Twist: if a player rolls a 6 twice in a row, their total score is reset to 0 and their turn ends.
 - The first player to reach 100 points (or the amount of points entered in the score-to-win box) wins the game.
